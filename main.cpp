/// This is the scanner class which contains all the functionality
/// of the compiler scanner. Its methods are called by main.cpp.
/// The implementation is based off  Dr. Aycock's example code 
/// in python, shown in the video series "Calculator demo video 
/// series" under "Other resources" on the CPSC 411 d2l page.
///
/// This implementation is written purely in C++, without the use
/// of tools (lex, flex, etc)
